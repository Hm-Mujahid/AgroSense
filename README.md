# 🌱 CropDoc

**CropDoc** is a lightweight plant disease detection system powered by the **ID3 decision tree algorithm**.  
It helps in identifying common plant diseases based on leaf symptoms like color, spots, and wilting.  
Designed for learning, scalable to real-world agricultural datasets.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🌿 Built with **ID3** (Entropy & Information Gain)  
- 📊 Small sample dataset included (`dataset.csv`)  
- ⚡ Scalable to **large datasets** using `scikit-learn`  
- 🔎 Human-readable decision tree rules

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

  - Python 3
  - pandas → data handling
  - numpy → entropy & math operations
  - scikit-learn → large dataset scaling (optional)

---

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CropDoc.git
cd CropDoc
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

##▶️ Usage :

Run with the sample dataset:
```bash
python main.py
```

##✅ Example Output
   ```bash
    Generated Decision Tree:
    {'Spots': {'Yes': 'Leaf_Spot', 'No': 'Wilt'}}
    
    Sample Input: {'Leaf_Color': 'Yellow', 'Spots': 'Yes', 'Wilting': 'No'}
    Predicted Disease: Leaf_Spot
    ```

##🌍Future Goals

Replace the small dataset with a larger one (e.g., PlantVillage dataset)
and use scikit-learn for efficient training:
        from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier        
        clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion="entropy", max_depth=10)
        clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
        print("Accuracy:", clf.score(X_test, y_test))
